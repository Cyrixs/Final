                 Mr.habibi is a man of great character and has a personality never seen before in any teacher in the Lindenhurst high school. There's never a day
                 that goes by without him leaving the class with a laugh or smile(shane kelly could have something to do with this). His stories on commiting various
                 illegal acts goes to show he knows more than a thing or two about computers, especially at such a young age.</h2></p>
